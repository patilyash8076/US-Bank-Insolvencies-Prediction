# Predicting US Bank Insolvencies using Machine Learning

## üìò Overview

Bank insolvencies can have significant ripple effects on the financial sector. This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify at-risk banks, offering early warnings to regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders. Leveraging historical financial data, the model helps assess the likelihood of bank failures, contributing to greater stability and resilience within the banking sector.

## üîç Key Components

1. **Data Processing**: Cleaned, transformed, and engineered historical bank data, focusing on financial metrics (CAMELS - Capital, Asset, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, Sensitivity).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized feature distributions, identified correlations, and optimized features for predictive accuracy.
3. **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE to improve model accuracy for the minority class.

## üöÄ Models Used

The project evaluates three models to predict bank insolvencies:

1. **Logistic Regression**: Simple, interpretable model showing feature influence on insolvency likelihood.
2. **Random Forest**: Ensemble model capturing non-linear relationships and performing well on high-dimensional data.
3. **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting model with regularization, excelling in accuracy by capturing complex data patterns.

The final model selection balances interpretability and predictive power, based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## üí° Benefits of the Model

- **Early Warning for Regulators**: Detects high-risk institutions in advance, allowing time for intervention.
- **Increased Financial Stability**: Enables proactive measures to bolster sector stability by identifying vulnerable banks early.
- **Stakeholder Risk Management**: Offers valuable insights for improved risk management and strategic decision-making.
- **Enhanced Predictive Capability**: Ensemble modeling improves the accuracy and reliability of predictions.
